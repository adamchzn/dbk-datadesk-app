## Diamondback Data Desk Application

### Adam's analysis of the College Park food inspection data. 

Story Pitch:

> I would suggest crafting a guide to the eating options in Stamp. 
>
> The broad scope of this dataset presents a challenge. I don’t think it would mean much to a reader that failed health inspections in College Park >restaurants have increased X%% as compared to the previous year.
>
>Because of this I would suggest narrowing the scope. Creating a STAMP food guide with dietary restrictions, links to menus, history of health inspections, >customer reviews, and a Diamondback staffer’s personal ratings could be a great way to incorporate the data in a way that’s relevant and interesting to >UMD students.

The original data set is linked in the repository as well as an R script with analysis and a sample graph.
