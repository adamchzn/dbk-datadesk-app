# Diamondback Data Desk Application

A brief analysis of the food inspection data for restaurants in the Adele H. STAMP Student Union. The original data set is linked in the repository as well as an R script with a brief analysis and a sample bar plot. A future, more polished chart might take the form of a bar plot, so that a reader could understand the specific violations (e.g. rodents, incorrect temperatures, hand washing, etc.).


### Story Pitch:

> I would suggest crafting a guide to the eating options in Stamp. 
>
> The broad scope of this dataset presents a challenge. I don’t think it would mean much to a reader that failed health inspections in College Park restaurants have increased X% as compared to the previous year.
>
>Because of this I would suggest narrowing the scope. Creating a STAMP food guide with dietary restrictions, links to menus, history of health inspections, customer reviews, and a Diamondback staffer’s personal ratings could be a great way to incorporate the data in a way that’s relevant and interesting to UMD students.
